# Swift/Objective-c Code for AguaPoints-App
#Old Firebase API 
App for iPhone versions above 9.0; helps users be productive by rewarding them for not using their phone in support of building water wells for people in need.

This is the first pass at putting the app together. It utilizes email login, Firebase hosting and database, Ads, local notifications and user data. I have learned many aspects of app development while solely developing this app and wish to further improve my skills in app development. I have updated the app a few times to fix bugs and add new features. I plan to rewrite some parts of the code to improve its peroformance and structure such as changing the if/else statements to switch, addings classes for parts of the app and adding new features in the app soon. Also need to update code to reflect Firebase's new API.
